# TODO: It's very hard to make local dev env to have trade-executor
# editable dependency with Poetry at the moment.
# Thus we assume is that if you install yourself, you have cloned
# trade-executor to ../trade-executor path.
# Or change the line below.
#
# Poetry develop = true and Visual Studio Code bug https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release/issues/4664
